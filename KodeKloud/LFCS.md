1. Essential Commands (%25)
  1. Logging System and Working with Files and Directories
      * ``man man``
      * ``apropos -s <comma-seper.-list-of-sections> <some-text>`` command searches for matching texts in the man pages. First time we try to use ``apropos``, we need to create the database with this ``sudo mandb``
      * ``cd -`` go to the previous directory
      * Hardlinks;
        * Inodes:
          * Inodes stores the data on disk.
            * ``stat <file_name>``
              * This gives an inode number. File systems such as XFS or Ext4 keep track of data wit hthe help of inodes. Inodes also keeps permissions, last modification date...
        * Links create a bound between Inodes and files in the file system. Links in stat command gives us the hard link count.
        * By links we could store just once and share the same file with hard links.
        * If we delete all the hard links from an inode, the data itself will be removed from the disk.
        * You can not hard link to directories and another file system 
        * ``ln <target_file> <file_to_be_linked>``
      * Softlinks
        * A link that points to a path.
        * ``ln -s <target_file> <file_to_be_linked>``
